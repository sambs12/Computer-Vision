#### Skin-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN
  Skin cancer is classified by two main types: benign and malignant. 
  Currently, 2-3 million non-melanoma and 132,000 melanoma skin cancers are diagnosed globally each year.
  The incidence of skin cancer is evident by a statistic based on the World Health Organization (WHO) that states that every 1 in 3 cancers diagnosed is a skin cancer. 
  The increased incidence of skin cancer is attributed to the depleted ozone level and as the atmophosphere loses its protective filter function, an increased amount of solar UV radiation will reach the Earth's surface. 
  Additionally, increased reactreation exposure to the sun and history of sunburn are main factors that predispose an individual to the development of skin cancer. 
  These factors are preventable and each individual is responsible to protect themselves from the sun (i.e., using sunblock).


#### About Dataset
  The Dataset contains image from 2 classes :benign and malignant.
  1800 Benigns and 1497 Malignant images in total.
  All these images are separated in to train and test dataset.
  
#### Objective
  The objective is to find a Deep Learning Classifier algorithm (Convolutional Neural Network) to detect whether the image is of class benign or malignant.
